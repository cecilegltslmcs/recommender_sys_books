# Recommender System for Books

This project is a proof of concept realised in order to obtain the diploma of Machine Learning Engineer (Openclassrooms & Centrale Supelec).

The aim of this project is to used the recent advances in recommender system to books. 
There are many applications that using recommender algorithms such as Netflix, Youtube or Spotify but book's recommender system is less common. 
In order to realise this proof of concept, datasets coming from Goodreads API were used. 
The datasets were downloaded on this page : [Datasets from Kaggle](!https://www.kaggle.com/bahramjannesarr/goodreads-book-datasets-10m).

The first part of this project was cleaning and exploration of the datasets. This exploration was made in two parts:
- One part on Books' informations
- The other part about Users Ratings' information. 
(This step is on WIP...)
